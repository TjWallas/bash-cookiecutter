# bash-cookiecutter
A cookiecutter template for writing safe bash scripts

*NOTE*: This template creates a script file in the current directory `.`. Cookiecutter fails to create a directory if it already exists on the filesystem by default. As `.` is used as the cookiecutter directory name, cookiecutter needs to be invoked with the `-f` option to force-overwrite files in an existing directory `.`.
